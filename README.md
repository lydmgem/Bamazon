# Bamazon
For this assignment, we are required to make a mock-up Amazon storefront using MySQL and Node.js. This app is currently just for customer orders. This assignment is to display our knowledge of how to use basic functions of a persistent storage.

BamazonCustomer:

* displays a table with the inventory
* takes a customer's order
* computes the cost
* depletes the stock from the store's inventory

Future Features:
* Manager View - where you, as the Manager, will be able to view products for sale, check low inventory, add more to your inventory, and add a new product.
