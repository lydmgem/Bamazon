# Bamazon
For this assignment, we are required to make a mock-up Amazon storefront using MySQL and Node.js. This app is currently just for customer orders. This assignment is to display our knowledge of how to use basic functions of a persistent storage.

BamazonCustomer:

* displays a table with the inventory
* takes a customer's order
* computes the cost
* depletes the stock from the store's inventory

Future Features:
* Manager View - where you, as the Manager, will be able to view products for sale, check low inventory, add more to your inventory, and add a new product.

# Getting Started:
* Have your MySQL Workbench open and connected to your local sever.
* Set up the schema by using the bamazonSchema.sql file.
* In order for you to get the same data into the table, you can use the bamazonSeeds.sql file to input the tables correctly.
* Refresh your Schema in order to display your newly made database and table.
* Make sure to run "SELECT * FROM products" in order for your table to appear.
* Then, you will be able to use the bamazonCustomer app.
